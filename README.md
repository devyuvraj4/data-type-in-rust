# Rust Data-type Learning  Game

Welcome to the Rust Learning Game! This program is designed to help you learn Rust's fundamental data types and operations in an interactive way. You can explore various Rust features by selecting different options from the menu.

## Features

1. **Integer Operations**: Learn about basic arithmetic, type casting, and bitwise operations.
2. **Floating-Point Operations**: Explore arithmetic operations, mathematical functions, and special floating-point values.
3. **Boolean Operations**: Understand logical operations on boolean values.
4. **Character Operations**: Discover operations on `char` values and their properties.
5. **String Operations**: Experiment with string manipulation, formatting, and slicing.
6. **Collections**: Work with vectors, hash maps, and hash sets to understand Rust's collection types.
7. **Option and Result**: Get familiar with handling optional values and error handling with `Option` and `Result`.

## Getting Started

To run this game, make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have Rust installed, you can get it from [the Rust official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Run the Game

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devyuvraj4/data-type-in-rust.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd data-type-in-rust
    ```
3. Build and run the project:
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
4. Follow the interactive prompts to learn about different Rust concepts

### How It Works


The game presents a menu of options. You can choose an option by entering the corresponding number. Each option will display information about a specific Rust feature, including the syntax and example code for various operations.

### Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of what you might see when you choose "Integer Operations":
```
--- Integer Operations ---
Variables: a = 10, b = 5
Sum: a + b = 15
Difference: a - b = 5
Product: a * b = 50
Quotient: a / b = 2
Remainder: a % b = 0
Converted x from i32 to u64: x as u64 = 42
Bitwise AND: c & d = 240
Bitwise OR: c | d = 255
Bitwise XOR: c ^ d = 15
Bitwise NOT: !c = 240
Checked addition result: x.checked_add(10) = Some(52)
```
